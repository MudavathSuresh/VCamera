# VCamera
*Just for fun or protect your camera privacy.*  

This is a powerful app that allows you to replace the camera with the video you specify.  </b>  
For example, when you are on a video call with a friend, what they see is the video you provide, not the camera's capture. How interesting that would be!  </b>    
This App can be used in both Apps and Games. Such as WhatsApp, IMO, Twitch, etc.
